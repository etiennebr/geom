Title: Spatial data for tibble
Description: Geom is an experiment to store spatial data in rows (rather than
    in a separate list like in sp). Most databases store geometries in a specific
    column, allowing multiple geometries per observation. `geom` is an attempt at
    replicating this structure. We'll see how far it can go.

# geom
Spatial data for tibble

This repository is an experiment to store spatial data in rows (rather than in a separate list like in sp). 
Most databases store geometries in a specific column, allowing multiple geometries per observation. 
`geom` is an attempt at replicating this structure.
We'll see how far it can go.
